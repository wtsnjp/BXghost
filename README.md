# The BXghost Package

LaTeX: ghost insertion for proper xkanjiskip

## Requirements

* TeX format: LaTeX
* TeX engine: LuaTeX, XeTeX, pTeX, upTeX, and ApTeX (pTeX-ng)
* LuaTeX-ja is required in LuaTeX

Since this package is intended to be used for creating documents in Japanese, it assumes appropriate classes and/or packages are loaded in some engines (e.g., LuaTeX-ja for LuaTeX and bxjscls for XeTeX).

## Usage

This package provides following commands:

* `\eghostguarded{<text>}` inserts *European ghost* (invisible and zero-width alphabets) before and after the `<text>`. In math mode, it outputs only `<text>` without the ghosts.
* `\jghostguarded{<text>}` inserts *Japanese ghost* (invisible and zero-width Japanese characters) before and after the `<text>`. In math mode, it outputs only `<text>` without the ghosts.

In addition, the following package options are available:

* `verb` patches the `\verb` command of LaTeX to be guarded by European ghost.
* `noverb` disables the `verb` feature. (default)

### For package authors

To use the function of this package in your package, a library version is available:

```tex
\RequirePackage{bxghost-lib}
```

This provides all the commands defined in the package but does not have any package option to prevent the problem of option clashes.
